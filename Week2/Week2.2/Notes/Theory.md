## ECMAScript

### What is ECMAScript?

- **ECMAScript** is a scripting language specification standardized by **ECMA International** in the **ECMA-262** specification.
- It serves as the **core standard** that JavaScript and other scripting languages (like ActionScript, JScript) are based on.
- It defines:
  - Syntax
  - Types
  - Statements
  - Keywords
  - Reserved words
  - Operators
  - Objects

## JavaScript

### What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** used to make web pages interactive.
- Originally developed by **Brendan Eich** at **Netscape** in 1995.
- It runs in the **browser** and follows the **ECMAScript** standard.

### Relationship with ECMAScript

- JavaScript **implements** the ECMAScript standard.
- Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc., implement JavaScript engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey) that **execute JavaScript code** based on ECMAScript rules.

## Node.js

### What is Node.js?

- **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, typically on a server.
- Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 engine**.
- Created by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.

### How Node.js Works

- Uses an **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**, ideal for scalable and real-time applications.
- Comes with **npm (Node Package Manager)** for managing libraries and dependencies.

**Features:**

- File system access
- Networking (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Child processes
- Custom modules
- CLI tools

## Bun

### What is Bun?

- **Bun** is a modern all-in-one JavaScript runtime like Node.js but **faster**.
- Built using **Zig language** and a custom JavaScript engine called **JavaScriptCore (from WebKit)**.
- Developed by **Jarred Sumner**.

### Key Features

- **Blazing fast** startup and execution
- Built-in bundler, transpiler (like Babel), and test runner
- Native TypeScript/TSX/JSX support
- Drop-in replacement for Node.js
- Uses **bun install** instead of npm/yarn for managing dependencies

## Conclusion

- **ECMAScript** is the **standard** that defines how JavaScript should behave.
- **JavaScript** is a language that follows ECMAScript and runs in browsers.
- **Node.js** allows JavaScript to run on the **server**.
- **Bun** is a modern alternative to Node.js with enhanced performance and built-in tools.

Each has its place:
- Use **ECMAScript** for theoretical foundations.
- Use **JavaScript** for web scripting.
- Use **Node.js** or **Bun** for backend development and tooling.
