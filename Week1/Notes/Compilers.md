## üîß What is a Compiler?

A **compiler** is a **program that takes your source code** (written in a high-level language like C, C++, or Java) and **translates it into machine code**, also known as **binary or executable code**, which your CPU can understand and run.

This translation process happens **before execution**, unlike interpreters which translate and run code **line-by-line at runtime**.

## üß≠ How Does a Compiler Work?

The process of compiling code happens in **multiple stages**, each responsible for a different aspect of understanding and transforming your code:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Lexical Analysis (Scanner Phase)**  
- Input: Source code
- Output: Tokens (e.g., keywords, variables, symbols)

**Example**:  
For this C code:
```c
int x = 5;
```
The scanner will break it into:
- `int` ‚Üí keyword
- `x` ‚Üí identifier
- `=` ‚Üí operator
- `5` ‚Üí literal
- `;` ‚Üí delimiter

> This step removes whitespace and comments too.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Syntax Analysis (Parser Phase)**  
- Input: Tokens
- Output: Parse Tree / Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The compiler now checks if the structure of the code is valid (using grammar rules). It builds a tree representing the program.

**Example**:  
Verifying that `int x = 5;` follows the grammar for a variable declaration.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Semantic Analysis**  
- Input: AST
- Output: Annotated AST or errors

This checks for **meaning**:
- Are variables declared before use?
- Are data types compatible?
- Is the function call valid?

**Example**:  
```c
int x = "hello"; // ‚ùå type mismatch error
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Intermediate Code Generation**  
- Converts the program to a middle-level language (between high-level and machine code)
- Easier to optimize and translate across platforms

**Example**: Some compilers use 3-address code (like `t1 = a + b`) at this stage.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Optimization**  
- Makes the intermediate code more efficient
- Removes unnecessary operations, simplifies expressions, reuses registers

> This step helps improve speed and reduce memory usage, but it doesn‚Äôt change the behavior of the code.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Generation**  
- Converts optimized intermediate code into **machine code** (binary)
- Targeted for a specific CPU architecture (e.g., x86, ARM)

This is the actual executable (.exe, .out, etc.).

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Linking and Loading**  
- Links your code with external libraries and system functions
- Produces the final **executable file**

Example: Linking with `stdio.h` for `printf()` in C

## üß™ Compiler Examples

| Language | Compiler Name |
|----------|----------------|
| C        | GCC, Clang     |
| C++      | G++            |
| Java     | `javac` (compiles to bytecode) |
| Rust     | `rustc`        |
| Go       | `go build`     |

## üîç Compiler vs Interpreter ‚Äî Key Differences

| Feature         | Compiler                        | Interpreter                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Translation Time | Entire code at once             | Line by line during execution   |
| Speed            | Faster after compiling          | Slower due to real-time parsing |
| Error Handling   | All errors shown after compile  | Stops at first error            |
| Examples         | C, C++, Java (to bytecode)      | Python, JavaScript, Ruby        |

## üß† Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're translating a book:

- A **compiler** is like translating the whole book into another language **before** publishing it.
- An **interpreter** is like reading the book and translating it **sentence by sentence** as someone listens.
