## 🧠 What Does *Single-Threaded* Mean?

- JavaScript has **one call stack** and **one thread** to execute code.
- This means it can **only do one thing at a time** — no true parallel execution in the main thread.

So if you write this:
```js
console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2");
console.log("Task 3");
```

It will always run **line-by-line**, in order. That’s the nature of **single-threaded execution**.

## 😨 So… Is JS Slow Because of That?

Not really — because of a powerful trick JS uses:

---

## 🧩 JavaScript + The Event Loop = Non-blocking Power

Even though it's single-threaded, JavaScript uses the **Event Loop**, **Web APIs**, and a **callback queue** to handle asynchronous tasks like:

- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- DOM Events (click, scroll)
- AJAX/fetch requests
- File system access (Node.js)

This lets JavaScript **handle long tasks in the background**, then come back to them **without blocking the main thread**.

### 🔄 Here's how it works:
```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Delayed");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Delayed
```

- JS runs “Start”
- Schedules the `setTimeout` in Web APIs
- Immediately runs “End”
- After 1 second, “Delayed” is added to the callback queue
- Event loop picks it up when the call stack is empty

## ⚠️ The Downside: Blocking the Thread

Since it’s single-threaded:
- A **heavy computation** (like a large loop) can block everything — **no UI updates, no event handling** during that time.

```js
while(true) {
  // blocks everything!
}
```

## ⚙️ How JS Handles Heavy Work:

- Use **Web Workers** (in browsers) for real multi-threaded processing
- Use **child processes or worker threads** in Node.js
- Split large tasks into chunks using `setTimeout` or `requestIdleCallback`

| Feature              | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Single-threaded**  | One main thread, one call stack               |
| **Async with event loop** | Handles async operations non-blockingly |
| **No true parallelism (by default)** | Long tasks can block the UI     |
| **Workarounds**      | Web Workers, Worker Threads, async patterns  |
